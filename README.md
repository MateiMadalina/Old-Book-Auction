# Old-Book-Auction

### Description
This project simulates a book auction, where 20 books are put up for auction, each having one of the following topics: Archeology, Astronomy, Chemistry, History, Medicine, Physics. The auction starts with an initial bidding price for each book, and the auctions continue until all books are sold or remain unsold.

### Functionality

- Bidding for books is done sequentially, with participants offering increasing prices for each book.
- If no bids are made for a particular book, it remains unsold.
- At the end of the auction, a small inventory is displayed in the console showing the total number of books sold and the books that remain unsold.

### Implementation

- The project is implemented in Java and utilizes object-oriented programming concepts to manage auctions and book transactions.
- Each book is represented by a Java class, with attributes such as title, topic, and current bidding price.
- Auctions are managed through business logic that allows participants to make bids and compete for books.
